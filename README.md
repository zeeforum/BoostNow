# BoostNow
Open Source E-commerce Project:

**BoostNow** is based on yii Framework. A complete **E-commerce project** currently is in development. I have created admin panel for the BoostNow using AdminLTE. Added some basic features. If you know how to setup on your web server you can do yourself. Otherwise you can ask for help. Soon I will write the instruction to setup the whole project. Once it's ready for production mode.

If you want to contibute in my project, please contact me. Drop me a message, I will get to you. If you find an issue in my project. Create an issue, I will resolve it as soon as possible. You can also **[track the project](https://github.com/zeeforum/BoostNow/projects/1)** performance/features completed, todo or in-progress.
